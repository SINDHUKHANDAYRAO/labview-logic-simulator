# LabVIEW Digital Logic Gate Simulator

This project is a basic **Digital Logic Gate Simulator** built using **LabVIEW**. It allows users to interactively explore the behavior of fundamental logic gates like AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.

---

## Features

- Enum-based gate selector (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
- Toggle switches for inputs A and B
- Real-time logic output using an LED indicator
- Supports all standard digital logic gates
- Clean and user-friendly GUI

---

## Applications

- Educational demonstration for students learning digital logic
- Quick logic simulation for lab exercises or teaching purposes
- Visual testing of logic gate behavior without physical hardware
